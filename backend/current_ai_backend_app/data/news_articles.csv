The price of a barrel of oil rose from $85.62 (£68.44) to $86.10 on Friday morning after the IEA’s report was published.
The move has angered western leaders because higher oil prices would make it harder for major economies to return to growth, and would provide extra revenues for the Kremlin as its war against Ukraine continues.
The expected increase in global oil demand has also dashed hopes among climate campaigners that the Covid-19 pandemic had hastened the end of the world’s rising oil demand.

Nathan Fillion stars as Malcolm Reynolds, the captain of a spacecraft called the Serenity.
The show takes place in the 26th century, when a massive solar system with hundreds of planets has been extensively terraformed.
As one might assume, the pilot episode of ""Firefly"" needed to establish the geography of the tiny Serenity spacecraft for audiences.
According to the 2006 sourcebook ""Firefly: The Official Companion,"" written by Whedon and Abbie Bernstein, the establishing shot was one of the hardest ever constructed for the series.","['system', 'firefly', 'reynolds', 'fireflys', 'difficult', 'filmed', 'serenity', 'spacecraft', 'whedon', 'nathan', 'planets', 'shot', 'series', 'fillion', 'shows']"

That tidbit then made its way into the U.K. tabloids, which garnered the notice of The Late Late Show.
Corden wrote the band’s “Best Song Ever” video in 2013, which was directed by Ben Winston, who would go on to executive produce The Late Late Show when Corden became host in 2015.

A Brazilian Supreme Court justice has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to testify within 10 days about the storming of key government buildings in the country’s capital by a mob of his supporters earlier this year.
On January 8, a week after Lula’s inauguration, tensions boiled over, with hundreds of Bolsonaro supporters marching on the Three Powers Plaza in an apparent attempt to disrupt the transfer of power.
Hundreds of rioters were arrested in the days after the attack and Bolsonaro and other officials have been scrutinised for their alleged roles.
Bolsonaro, who returned to Brazil at the end of last month, faces a number of investigations on top of the January 8 probe.","['president', 'judge', 'court', 'bolsonaros', 'bolsonaro', 'supreme', 'supporters', 'testify', 'capital', 'electoral', 'riots', 'attack', 'brazil', 'days', 'brazils', 'orders']"

Asked about an inheritance tax cut, a government spokesperson declined to comment on future tax policy, saying Sunak’s priority is to cut inflation.
Inheritance tax receipts are skewed toward wealthier households in the Conservative’s southern England stronghold, so reducing what some describe as a death duty could help shore up the base.
In that sense, cutting inheritance tax would fit the bill.
It would not be the first time the Conservatives have promised to cut inheritance tax before an election campaign.","['election', 'tories', 'eyes', 'party', 'tax', 'conservative', 'cut', 'conservatives', 'gear', 'inheritance', 'sunak', 'voters', 'uk']"
